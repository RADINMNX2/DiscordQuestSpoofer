## 🛠️ FAQ & Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this require installing the game?</strong></summary>
No! The plugin modifies your local Discord client to report that the game is running (PID Spoofing). You don't need to download anything.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I pressed Ctrl+Q but nothing happened.</strong></summary>
1. Make sure the plugin is enabled in BetterDiscord/Vencord settings.
2. Check if you have any other plugins conflicting with keybinds.
3. Check the console (Ctrl+Shift+I > Console) for errors and report them.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I get banned?</strong></summary>
While any modification of the Discord client is technically against TOS, this plugin is considered <strong>safe</strong> because it does not automate user actions (like spamming messages) or exploit server-side vulnerabilities. It simply tells your local client "Hey, I'm playing Minecraft" when you aren't.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>It says "Modules not loaded".</strong></summary>
Sometimes Discord updates break internal modules. Try restarting Discord (Ctrl+R). If it persists, check for a plugin update.
