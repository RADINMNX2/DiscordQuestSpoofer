## 🛠️ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to install the actual game?**
A: **No!** The plugin tricks Discord into thinking the game is running locally.

**Q: Does it work for "Stream to a friend" quests?**
A: **Yes.** Select "Stream on Desktop" in the spoofer. You just need to be in a voice channel (even alone or with an alt account) for Discord to register the stream.

**Q: Is this safe?**
A: Yes. This plugin purely modifies local client variables to simulate game activity. It does not spam the API maliciously.
